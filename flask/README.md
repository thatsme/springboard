1) Project is under development, so directory structure,  files, web app men√π can change radically
2) requirements.txt don't have at the moment the level of libraries
3) run.cmd and build.cmd are the files for build Docker image and run it ( i'm working on windows )
4) Dockerfile is still on development, can change in any moment due to whatever :)
5) There are for sure files useless, not needed, so files i have to trash, not now .. later 
6) Thanks for the patient
