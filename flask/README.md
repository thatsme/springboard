1) Project is under development, so directory structure,  files, web app men√π can change radically
2) requirements.txt don't have at the moment the level of libraries
3) run.cmd and build.cmd are the files for build Docker image and run it ( i'm working on windows )
4) Dockerfile is still on development, can change in any moment due to whatever :)
5) There are for sure files useless, not needed, so files i have to trash, not now .. later 
6) Thanks for the patient

Instructions
- actually work with :
    - docker desktop for windows version 2.3.0.3 ( 45519 ) 

for build the container : build.cmd
for run the container : run.com
